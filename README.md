# Introduction ⚒  
So COVID TODAY is an COVID detection App which uses Chest XRay of person to examine it.This app works on a ML Model which iss used to derive the desired result. Other than
that the app also provides live updates of total cases in world. Even here it doesn't stops, the app even shows the worst affected areas in a Map View. The app consists 
of various sort of option like help, diagnose, hospitalisation etc. The app even consists of in built journals which explains about the symptoms and precautions for COVID.
The app gives you a desired result with 93% accuracy.

# Inspiration ❤️
This idea came to my mind when I was thinking of how do covid detection really happens, then i read an article where i found the first tage of COVID detection is done through
chest XRay, so i thought why not try to make a ML model which helps to find result. Then when i made the model i thought of making an app which comprises of this feature and the rest
is here.

# Impact on Society 🌏
This app helps you in solving two major problems of society, 1.Reduction in use of Carbon film & 2.Fast and secure detection. As the app requires your chest XRay, you dont
need an hard copy of it just get an soft copy, upload it on app and your work is done. Thus this helps in avoiding use of carbon films and you can get your result within
seconds.
